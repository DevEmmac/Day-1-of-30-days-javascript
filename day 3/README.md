## *Exercises: Level 2*
1. Write a script that prompt the user to enter base and height of the triangle and calculate an area of a triangle (area = 0.5 x b x h).
```
Enter base: 20
Enter height: 10
The area of the triangle is 100
```
2. Write a script that prompt the user to enter side a, side b, and side c of the triangle and and calculate the perimeter of triangle (perimeter = a + b + c)
```
Enter side a: 5
Enter side b: 4
Enter side c: 3
The perimeter of the triangle is 12
```
3. Get length and width using prompt and calculate an area of rectangle (area = length x width and the perimeter of rectangle (perimeter = 2 x (length + width))

4. Get radius using prompt and calculate the area of a circle (area = pi x r x r) and circumference of a circle(c = 2 x pi x r) where pi = 3.14.

5. Calculate the slope, x-intercept and y-intercept of y = 2x -2

6. Slope is m = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1). Find the slope between point (2, 2) and point(6,10)

7. Compare the slope of above two questions.

8. Calculate the value of y (y = x2 + 6x + 9). Try to use different x values and figure out at what x value y is 0.

9. Writ a script that prompt a user to enter hours and rate per hour. Calculate pay of the person?
```
Enter hours: 40
Enter rate per hour: 28
Your weekly earning is 1120
```
10. If the length of your name is greater than 7 say, your name is long else say your name is short.

11. Compare your first name length and your family name length and you should get this output.
```
let firstName = 'Asabeneh'
let lastName = 'Yetayeh'
```
```
Your first name, Asabeneh is longer than your family name, Yetayeh
```
12.  Declare two variables myAge and yourAge and assign them initial values and myAge and yourAge.
```
let myAge = 250
let yourAge = 25
```
```
I am 225 years older than you.
```
13. Using prompt get the year the user was born and if the user is 18 or above allow the user to drive if not tell the user to wait a certain amount of years.
```
Enter birth year: 1995
You are 25. You are old enough to drive

Enter birth year: 2005
You are 15. You will be allowed to drive after 3 years.
```
14. Write a script that prompt the user to enter number of years. Calculate the number of seconds a person can live. Assume some one lives just hundred years
```
Enter number of years you live: 100
You lived 3153600000 seconds.
```
15. Create a human readable time format using the Date time object

YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm
DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm


## *Exercises: Level 3*

1. Create a human readable time format using the Date time object. The hour and the minute should be all the time two digits(7 hours should be 07 and 5 minutes should be 05 )
YYY-MM-DD HH:mm eg. 20120-01-02 07:05
