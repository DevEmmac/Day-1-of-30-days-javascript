# DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL(DOM)

### EventListeners 
We can add event listener to any Dom object.we also use addEventListener() method to listen to different event types on HTML elements. it takes two arguments which are event listener and a callback function.

### list of EventListener
* Click :- when the element clicked
* Double click :- when the element double clicked
* Mouse enter :-when the mouse point enter to the element
* input :- when value enter to input field
* change :- when value change on input field
*blur :- when the element is not focused
* keydown :- when a key is down
* keyup :- when a key is up

### Getting value from an input element 
This can be done by creating Form fields using input HTML.

* input event and change :- we can use the change or input event type to get data right away from the input field when the field is on focus
* blur event :- the blur event occur when the input field is not on focus.
